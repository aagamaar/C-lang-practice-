Here, is the screenshot of my ubuntu terminal ....
I am ensuring whether the gcc compiler is installed .. yes it is.
I am creating C programs through gedit.
Like this ---------> gedit p1.c
And then I write the program in the file.
After writing the program, I compile it through the command ---------------> gcc p1.c
And if there are any errors, this would show that in this line , this error. In this line, this error. After correcting all of these or if you have no errors.......
Go execute by the command ---------->  ./a.out

THAT'S IT...

Then I had a really hard time figuring out the git pushing and it's errors because of the branch diversions in local branches ,main and master branches....
